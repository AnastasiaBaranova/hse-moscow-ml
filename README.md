Lectures on Machine Learning at HSE, Moscow

# Machine Learning @ Applied Statistics with Network Analysis, HSE, Moscow

This repository includes teaching materials related to the elective course Machine Learning taught at the [HSE-Moscow](https://www.hse.ru/en/) masters programme [Applied Statistics with Network Analysis](https://www.hse.ru/en/ma/sna/). The materials are organized in sections corresponding to lecture days. Each section provides a brief outline of the topics addressed, access to the lecture slides, outline of the practical exercises and seminars, and references to the relevant literature.

For further information on the course, students can contact the lecturers via email at [Nada Lavraƒç](mailto:nada.lavrac@ijs.si) and [Ljupco Todorovski](mailto:ljupco.todorovski@fu.uni-lj.si).
